# About the Full Stack Reviews Website #
I built a website to house a variety of reviews with different categories. The main page lists all the reviews. Clicking on each page will take the visitor to that specific review. On the individual review page, it has the review title, date, image, category, and the content of the review. On each individual review page, there's also a link that will take the visitor to the main page where they can again see all reviews.
