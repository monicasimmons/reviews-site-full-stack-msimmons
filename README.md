# About the Full Stack Reviews Website #
I built a website to house a variety of reviews with different categories. There are pages that list all the reviews, each individual review, all the review categories, and each individual category. Each individual review page contains the review title, date, image, category, and the content of the review. The indvidual category page contains all the reviews in that category. On every page, there is a navigation, allowing you to go to either the Reviews or Reviews Category page (unless you're on one of them).
